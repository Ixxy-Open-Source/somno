## Setting up the application in development
Python and pip should already be installed however you will need to install some extra development tools to make sure everything installs without errors

On Debian/Ubuntu systems and on bash for windows type
```bash
sudo apt-get install libpq-dev
```

On RHEL/fedora use
```bash
sudo dnf install postgresql-devel python-dev rpm-build
```

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py createsuperuser
python manage.py runserver
```

To access the application, visit http://127.0.0.1:8000 in a browser, select lists, add a patient.


To view the live chart go to: http://127.0.0.1:8000/#/patient/1/anaesthetic_readings

## I want to feed data
You need a token to go in http header "Authorization: Token <token goes here>" you can get a token for a user by running:

```bash
python manage.py gettoken <username>
```
You can then use this to feed in data to the application with the default dummy data
(make sure the three arguments have quotation marks around them)

```bash
./manage.py insertdata <file location> <address of the install> <api token>
```
if you are feeding to a local install you will have to run this in another tab while the server is running

finally to load some of the fixture data run
```bash
./manage.py load_lookup_lists
```
